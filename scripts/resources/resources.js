Huffington's second book, which she tried to publish long before she created the now ubiquitously recognizable Huffington Post empire, was rejected 36 times before it was eventually accepted for publication.",
            paragraph2: "&nbsp;  Even Huffington Post itself wasn't a success right away. In fact, when it launched, there were dozens of highly negative reviews about its quality and its potential.

However, despite public fear and criticism of Steinbrenner's controversial decisions, eventually he led the team to an amazing comeback, with six World Series entries between 1996 and 2003, and a record as one of the most profitable teams in Major League Baseball.",
